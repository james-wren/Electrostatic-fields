Added a basic gui, when you press the plot button, it plots the points bellow the button. It was actually pretty easy in contradiction to my original beliefs. Now need to add a way for the user to imput charge positions, resize graph, determine charge intesity. Also need to update comments and finish [math.md](/docs/math.md) along with making other documentation.
