Learned how to actually structure a project (I think), simply setup the [field generator](/src/simulation/field_generator.py) so its in its own folder and can be called from [main.py](/src/main.py), now need to buckle down and learn how to make a gui. Also need to update comments and finish [math.md](/docs/math.md) along with making other documentation.
