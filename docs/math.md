# Basic Idea
## Base Equation:
$$E = \frac{kd}{r^2}$$
Foo the sake of the simulation **K is equal to 1**

## Known Variables:
<div style='text-align: center'>X and Y of point for calculation<div>
<br>
<div style='text-align: center'>X, Y, and charge (q) of particle<div>

## Calculating Forces with one particle
$$dx = x_{point} -  x_{charge}$$
$$dy = y_{point} - x_{charge}$$
The pythagorem theorum is then used to get the the distance between the point and charge (r)
$$r = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}$$
Now the formula for
