# Eletrostatic Field Simulation
My first attempt at creating and publishing a real program with an actual purpose. 
The goal is to have a program where users can place positive and negative particles, and it will simulate and display their Electrostatic fields.
I am also yet to take any physics classes or math beyond algebra 2, the rest of the math is self-taught, so please let me know if I make any mistakes.
